## Bo Fang (方波)

I am studying for a master's degree at [Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://www.iie.ac.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yu Zhou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yuzhou). Prior to that, I recieved my B.E. degree in software engineering from [Xiamen University (XMU)](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/). I am interested in *video understanding*, typically in *video self-supervised representation learning* and *video-text cross-modal pretraining & retrieveing*.

<font color=#00ffff>I will graduate in 2023 Fall, and am looking for a PhD or RA position, working on computer vision research.</font>
