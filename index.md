## Bo Fang (方波)

I am studying for a master's degree at [Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://www.iie.ac.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Yu Zhou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~yuzhou). Prior to that, I recieved my B.E. degree in software engineering from [Xiamen University (XMU)](https://www.xmu.edu.cn/). I am interested in *video understanding*, typically in *video self-supervised representation learning* and *video-text cross-modal pretraining & retrieving*.

<!-- 
I will graduate in 2023 Fall, and am looking for a PhD or RA position, working on computer vision research and applications.

### Research Interests

My research is in the area of video-related vision tasks and video content understanding, with an emphasis on video self-supervised representation learning and video-text cross-modal retrieving. Meanwhile, I have stayed up with my eye on contrastive self-supervised learning, vision base model developments, and large-scale (vision-language) pretraining, which can overall boost my research in videos.
